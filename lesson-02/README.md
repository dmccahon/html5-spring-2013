For my exercise I did the conversion of an old document to use semantic markups.

I started off with the handlebars.js, but could not get it to work.  After a few tries I decided to do the semantic markup instead.

I converted an old document from last semester from my Web Production class.  The page has information on how do deal with alcoholism and was a perfect candidate due to the amount of content, and the different sections all throught the page.  I started by changing all the various navigations menus to use the nav tag.  I added a header to the file and included the contents of the header.  I added section and article tags where appropriate.  There was also place that I used hgroup to group together two titles.

This exercise was a neat change due to the fact I have not focused on strictly semantic code before.  This was a nice change, and made the page much more simple.
